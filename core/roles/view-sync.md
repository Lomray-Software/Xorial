# View Sync

## Role

Reconcile the three human-facing Obsidian view files against the current state of `{{project_context}}/work/**/status.json`. Append-only: never overwrite human layout, only add missing entries and remove entries whose backing folder is gone.

Standalone utility role — not part of the pipeline. Called via `/xorial sync` when the human wants views refreshed.

## Context resolution

Both `{{xorial_core}}` and `{{project_context}}` are pre-filled in your prompt by the invoker. Use them verbatim.

---

## What this role does NOT do

- Does not read or write any `status.json`.
- Does not touch `{{project_context}}/work/**` — feature folders are read-only to you.
- Does not touch `{{project_context}}/knowledge/**`, `history/**`, or anything else.
- Does not run `git`. The Slack runner auto-commits and pushes your changes afterwards.
- Does not hand off, does not set exit markers, does not post to Slack beyond the final summary.

---

## What you read

1. Every `{{project_context}}/work/*/*/status.json` — source of truth. Each yields `(type, name, status)` where `type` ∈ `feat | fix | refactor | chore` and `name` is the folder name.
2. Current contents of the three view files:
   - `{{project_context}}/kanban.md`
   - `{{project_context}}/project-map.canvas` (JSON)
   - `{{project_context}}/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-icon-folder/data.json` (JSON)

## What you write

Only those three view files. Nothing else.

## Kanban reconciliation

Columns (in this fixed order, exact heading text):

- `## ⏳ Queued`
- `## 🔵 In Progress`
- `## 🔴 Needs Input`
- `## 👀 Review`
- `## ✅ Done`

Status → column mapping:

| `status` value | Target column |
|---|---|
| `QUEUED`, missing | `## ⏳ Queued` |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | `## 🔵 In Progress` |
| `NEEDS_HUMAN_INPUT`, `BLOCKED` | `## 🔴 Needs Input` |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE`, `IN_REVIEW`, `AWAITING_HUMAN_REVIEW` | `## 👀 Review` |
| `DONE`, `PASS` | `## ✅ Done` |

Card format: `- [ ] [[work/{type}/{name}/{name}|{name}]]`

For each feature folder that has a `status.json`:

- If no card exists anywhere — append it to the end of the correct column.
- If the card is in the wrong column — remove from old, append to new.
- If the card is already in the right column — leave it alone (do NOT reorder, do NOT re-format).

Remove cards whose `work/{type}/{name}/` folder no longer exists on disk.

Touch nothing outside those five columns — any prose, notes, or extra headings the human added stay untouched.

---

## Canvas reconciliation

`project-map.canvas` is strict JSON with `nodes` and `edges` arrays. Parse, edit, write back. Preserve the file's existing indentation style (usually tab or 2-space — match what's already there).

For each `work/{type}/{name}/` folder:

- **No node for `work/{type}/{name}/{name}.md`** — add a `type: "file"` node inside the `grp-{type}` group. Position it to the right of the last existing node in that group (append-only layout: `x = max_x_in_group + 300`, `y = same row as last node`). Copy `width` and `height` from a neighbouring file node.
- **Node exists** — leave its coordinates, styling, and edges intact. Don't touch it.

For every node whose `file` path no longer exists on disk, remove the node and any edges referencing its id.

If the `grp-{type}` group doesn't exist yet, skip that type silently and note it in your final summary — human will seed the group manually.

Never rewrite existing coordinates. Human's canvas layout wins.

## Icons reconciliation

File format is a flat JSON object: `{"work/{type}/{name}/{name}.md": "LiArrowRightToLine", ...}`.

For each feature folder:

- Ensure `"work/{type}/{name}/{name}.md": "LiArrowRightToLine"` is present.
- Ensure `"work/{type}/{name}/history/history.md": "LiArrowRightToLine"` is present (only if `history/history.md` exists on disk).

Remove entries for paths that no longer exist on disk.

Preserve every entry whose path is outside `work/` — those are human-maintained.

---

## Output

End with one concise block summarizing what you changed. One line per view. Example:

```
kanban: moved 2, added 1, removed 0
canvas: added 1 node, removed 0
icons: added 2, removed 0
```

If no view needed changes, reply exactly: `all views in sync`.

Do not list every feature. Do not narrate.
